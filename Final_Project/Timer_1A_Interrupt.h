 * This file contains the function definitions for the Timer_1A_Interrupt driver.
 * It uses the Timer 1A module to generate periodic interrupts at a specified rate.
 *
 * @note Timer 1A has been configured to generate periodic interrupts every 1 ms
 * for the Timers lab.
 *
 * @note This driver assumes that the system clock's frequency is 50 MHz.
 * 
 * @note Refer to Table 2-9 (Interrupts) on pages 104 - 106 from the TM4C123G Microcontroller Datasheet
 * to view the Vector Number, Interrupt Request (IRQ) Number, and the Vector Address
 * for each peripheral.
